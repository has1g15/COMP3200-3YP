6,Welcome to JavaScript String Handling Tutorial,$This is the console,"There are several ways that strings can be manipulated in JavaScript, we will cover a handful of these methods"
6,"£var hello = hel.concat("" "", ""lo"");",$-,"Firstly, we can join two strings together, this is called concatentation. We can either use a + in between the strings we want to join or include them as parameters in the concat() method, as shown in the example. "
6,£console.log(hello.toUpperCase());,$HELLO,Strings can be converted to all upper or lower case using the toLowerCase() or toUpperCase methods
6,£console.log(hello.length);,$5,"To get the length of a string, .length can be added after the string, returning a number"
6,"£console.log(hello.indexOf(""lo""));",$4,"indexOf() can be used to find the position of the first occurrence of a specified string within a string. In the example, 3 is returned as ""lo"" starts at the 4th position in the string. (Remebering indexes start from 0)"
6,"£console.log(hello.slice(2, 4));",$llo,The slice() method cuts a string and stores the extracted part in a new string. The start and end position of the sliced string are specified as paramters. 
6,"£console.log(hello.slice(2, 3));",$llo,The final method we'll look at is .substr(). This is similar to slice() but the second paramter specified is the length of the substring rather than the end position.
